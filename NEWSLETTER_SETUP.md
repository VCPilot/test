## How the Email Parser Works

```python
# Simplified workflow
1. Connect to inbox via IMAP
2. Search for unread emails since last run
3. For each email:
   - Identify source (from address/subject)
   - Extract links from email body
   - Parse article titles and summaries
   - Classify by category (based on newsletter source)
4. Deduplicate by URL
5. Generate report
```

**Source mapping:**
- Email from `*@asic.gov.au` â†’ Regulation
- Email from `*@fintechaustralia.org.au` â†’ Disruptive Trends
- Email from `*@afr.com` â†’ Market Trends / Competition
- Email from `*@privacy.org.nz` â†’ Regulation
